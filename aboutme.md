Hi, I am Brooke! I am a molecular epidemiologist working on my PhD at Emory through the Population Biology, Ecology, and Evolution Program. I am a member of [Dr. Tim Read's lab](https://emergent.emory.edu/), where we focus primarily on the evolution of bacterial pathogens and work to understand patterns of transmission, antibiotic resistance, and virulence through bioinformatic approaches. I use this space to share code, write about infectious diseases, and discuss graduate life and careers in public health. I also like bees. This is a work in progress - thanks for stoping by!

Hi, I am Brooke! I am a molecular epidemiologist working on my PhD at Emory through the Population Biology, Ecology, and Evolution Program. I am a member of [Dr. Tim Read's lab](https://emergent.emory.edu/), where we focus primarily on the evolution of bacterial pathogens and work to understand patterns of transmission, antibiotic resistance, and virulence through bioinformatic approaches. I use this space to share code, write about microbiology and infectious diseases, and discuss graduate life and a career in public health. You can also catch me running over sidewalks and soil and sometimes talking to bees.

You can learn more about me by checking out [this blog post](https://bmtalbot.github.io/2024-04-01-Hello-World/), and to see some of my published contributions to science, check out the [Publications page](https://bmtalbot.github.io/publications/)
